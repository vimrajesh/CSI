                    Starting off as a talented but not so famous standup comedian, Mr. Robin Williams was hired by Harvey Weinstein, producer of The Weinstein Company. Williams established a great career under him as a standup comedian. He was workaholic, gentle and also was known for his improvisation skills and political satires. Very cautious by nature, he ensured that his work stayed away from the public eye before it was released. It is believed that he kept the script and content of his latest show locked up and never took it out until the day of his death. After 3 eventful years of his work under Harvey Weinstein, his wife Marsha Graces died in a tragic car accident. His son, Cody Williams, subsequently turned to drugs and had frequent run-ins with the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration). This was said to have affected Robin’s personal life. Mr. Williams switched to CBS Television Network in 2004. He won an Emmy Award for the Best Variety Talk Series for his performance in the critically acclaimed show Why So Serious with Robin Williams which he did under Weinstein. His death came just a week before the broadcast of his first show on CBS.
