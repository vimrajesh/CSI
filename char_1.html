                    Started off as a writer at CBS for a variety of talk shows and sitcoms in 1974, Morton is a

                    profession and he has a knack to talk out things on-screen. He became a well-established producer by
                    the 1990s. He launched many successful shows and has 9 shows currently under his production. Morton

                <b>Ins:</b> State your name and profession. <br>
                <b>Morton :</b> My name is Robert W Morton. I am an executive producer at CBS television networks. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> How do you know Mr. Williams? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> He was employed under my production for the past 3 months. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> Did you know him before he started working for you? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> No. But I have had the pleasure of going to some of his shows and I was a fan of his work
                over at Weinstein’s Productions. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> So Mr. Morton, I believe that you are the person who came across the body and informed the
                police. <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> Yes, I found Robin dead in his room around 7 in the morning. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> What was the purpose of your visit to his room so early in the morning? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> The previous night he had asked me to come up to his room the next day to wake him up, so
                that we could go to the studio together. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> Alright. Can you walk me through what happened the previous night? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> Well after the ceremony, the after-party started around 9:30. Robin and I were having
                some drinks, celebrating Robin’s big night and Richard joined us. And then, this guy... uh... yeah
                Dixon, he came over. He was quite intoxicated and started yelling at Robin about his content or
                something. He struck up quite the scene, and it was Latt who tried to pacify the argument and this
                really irritated Robin. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> Do you know why Mr. Dixon would do that? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> As far as I know, Robin and Larry were friends from college and after Robin’s speech that
                night, I guess Larry felt that he wasn’t given credit for his work with Robin. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> What did you mean when you said Mr. Williams got irritated? Do you remember what triggered
                him? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> The situation was under control at first, but Robin lost it when Latt entered the scene.
                He suddenly turned his attention towards Latt and fired him on the spot. Robin had his suspicions that
                Latt had been sabotaging our show... In fact, I was the one who recommended the dismissal. But I didn’t
                expect him to do it. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> I see. Was that all that happened? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> No. After all that ruckus, Robin walked Larry to an empty counter to have a word with
                him, I guess. Later, I just saw Larry storming off while Robin rejoined us at the table. I don’t mean
                any disrespect when I say that he was all about himself for the rest of the night until he told me that
                he was gonna take off. And he also did ask me to wake him up early in the morning so that we could leave
                for the studio together. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> Where were you around midnight? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> I got a call around 10:30 about some accident at the studio, that an equipment had broken
                down. So I had to go back to the studio, along with Richard to handle the issue. These things can turn
                into lawsuits real quick, and that’s really something I don’t need on my plate right now. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> Were you both at the studio the entire night? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> Yeah, I was there for the night until the issue was sorted out. Richard went back an hour
                later as it was getting late. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> Okay. So tell me something about Mr Williams. I heard he was quite successful under Mr
                Weinstein. What was his reason for leaving that studio? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> Robin was a stage person with such charisma that captivated the audience. I felt that my
                network could offer a better platform for him to extend his talents, and of course y’know my profits. So
                I got in touch with his agent and offered him a better deal. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> So you got in touch with him through Mr. Latt? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> Yes. Latt did agree and he said that he’d take care of it. But later he came asking for
                more payment than what I had agreed to. Y’know how people can be greedy at times, leeching off of the
                fame of talented people. But I didn’t mind. It just felt like a bang-for-the-buck kind of deal. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> I don’t buy it. Surely Mr.Weinstein could have offered more money to keep Mr. Williams with
                his studio? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> Yes he could’ve. But... well, between you and me officer, money wasn’t the only thing
                Latt was interested in... <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> What else could be the reason? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> He said that Robin would be mine to keep if I could maybe swing the Emmy’s to his favour.
                <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> Go on. <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> I am not proud of what I did, but you could say I used some of my influence. Y’know how
                these things go. Finally what took place was that a large section of the academy voted for Robin rather
                than our in-house nomination, Richard. It’s just a classic case of wise spending, if y’know what I mean.
                <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> The switch of shows of Mr. Williams was controversial and then Mr. Wolff was replaced at his
                own show. Were they on good terms post that incident? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> Well he didn’t seem all happy about it. But later, he seemed to be okay about the show
                being in the right hands. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> Do you know the reason why Mr. Wolff was unhappy on being replaced? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> Well, it was just that Under The Radar was all about drugs and drug rackets. If I’m
                right, it was Richard’s passion to do it after all that had happened to his brother, y’know . But then
                he was content with a late-night talk-show he was getting instead. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> Okay. So I understand that Mr Williams was under your employment for all of 3 months.
                Anything you would want to share about that period? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> Well, it didn’t go as well as I had hoped with Robin. The production wasn’t smooth at
                all, y’know. There were some minor issues in the first month. But, later it got worse. There were
                multiple attempts to sabotage the show’s script. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> Sabotaging, you say? Did you find out who was responsible? <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> Yeah... yeah I did. It was that little brat Latt. I caught him red handed one day messing
                with the lockers where the scripts are stored. He pretended to fetch the scripts but it became quite
                evident that he was trying to sabotage the script. <br>
                <b>Ins:</b> Hmm, that could be quite helpful. Thank you for your time. <br>
                <b>Morton:</b> No problems chief. <br>
